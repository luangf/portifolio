🚧 **A portfolio that I'm working on.**  
For now I know that the pages are made weird it has everything on the same '.html'
I'm still improving it.

🛠️ **The main one I'm working on is called `main.html`.**  
There I want to make a display of some personal projects.
All of the images in there, including the one on the introduction, are not from me (That's really important).
When I finish I will put my picture and the images from my projects.
I'm gonna keep working on it and try to improve my knowledge while doing so.

The final one is useless, I made it in less than one afternoon because of a course. However I plan to change it in the future.
